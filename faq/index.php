              <p class="verse__copy">
              Watsi is a global crowdfunding platform for healthcare that enables anyone to donate as little as $5 to directly fund life-changing medical care for people in need. Watsi is a registered U.S. 501(c)(3) non-profit organization.

              We believe that every person deserves access to medical care, regardless of their nationality, religion, or socioeconomic status. We envision a world where people no longer die from conditions that society has the knowledge, resources, and power to treat. Watsi isn’t a charity. Watsi is a non-profit startup bringing the world together to provide access to a fundamental human right.

              On December 3, 2010, Chase was traveling on a bus in the Talamanca Indigenous Territory of Costa Rica when a woman boarded the bus and asked the passengers for donations to pay for her son’s medical treatment. This experience led to the birth of Watsi, named after the town Chase was traveling through at the time.

              <p class="verse__copy">
              In order to be eligible for Watsi funding, patients must be afflicted with a condition that, if left untreated, will severely impact their standard of living. Treatments eligible for Watsi funding cost less than $3000 USD, have a high probability of success, and are financially out-of-reach for the patient in need. In short, Watsi treatments are low-cost and high-impact.
              </p>

              <h3 class="verse__heading" id="about">Can Watsi patients pay for treatment?</h3>
              <p class="verse__copy">
              No. Watsi only posts profiles for patients who are unable to afford the medical care they need as a result of poverty. Our Medical Partners use their local knowledge and experience to vet the patients that apply for Watsi care. However, in most cases, our Medical Partners operate in communities that are so deprived economically that it is unrealistic to expect anyone living there to be able to afford the type of medical care Watsi donors fund.

              <p class="verse__copy">
              When Medical Partners send us patient profiles, we confirm that they meet our criteria. We cannot see and evaluate patients ourselves, so we trust that our Medical Partners are choosing the best treatments available to the patients, in their particular setting. Then, we post the profiles as we are able. In the instance we have more profiles than we can fund at any one time, we are committed to posting the lowest-cost, highest-impact profiles first.

              <p class="verse__copy">
              Profiles are posted on Watsi until they are fully funded. We work closely with our Medical Partners to determine how many profiles we will be able to fund based on current donor demand. If donor demand increases, we increase the number of profiles our partners can submit for funding, and vice versa.

              Every treatment posted on Watsi is considered to have a high probability of success by the Medical Partner that submitted it. We trust their local knowledge and expertise to make that decision. That said, we can’t guarantee that every treatment funded by Watsi will be successful.

              Watsi Medical Partners are well-respected, trusted organizations that are committed to providing the highest level of care possible. In extreme, heartbreaking circumstances, it’s possible that a patient may not make it. If a patient passes away before receiving a treatment funded by Watsi, Watsi donors will be given the option to reallocate their donation to another patient or receive a full refund. If a patient passes away after receiving a treatment funded by Watsi, Watsi donors will receive an update notifying them about what happened.

              In rare cases, a patient may not receive the treatment that was funded for them on Watsi. This may happen if a patient decides against treatment at the last minute, no longer needs care, or passes away before treatment is provided. If this happens, Watsi will give donors the option to reallocate their donations to another Watsi patient, or receive a full refund.

              <p class="verse__copy">
              Medical care in developing countries is significantly less expensive than in the U.S. and other developed nations. We also work closely with our Medical Partners to find creative ways to reduce the cost of medical care for Watsi patients. In many cases, a percentage of the treatment cost is subsidized by the local government and/or doctors agree to donate their time.

              <p class="verse__copy">
              Our mission is to fund low-cost, high-impact medical care. While we’re not opposed to working in the United States, we currently focus our efforts in developing countries because it’s more frequently the case that a relatively small amount of money stands in the way of someone receiving life-changing care.

              <p class="verse__copy">
              In some cases, Medical Partners may need to provide medical care to a patient before their profile is fully funded on Watsi. We allow this because we know that when a patient has a serious injury or illness, it sometimes requires immediate attention, and we are committed to doing whatever it takes to allow our Medical Partners to do their jobs as best they can. Once we receive an update from the Medical Partner and the profile has been fully funded on Watsi, we transfer the funds to the Medical Partner to cover the cost of care.

              Medical Partners are on-the-ground organizations that provide reliable medical care to underserved populations in developing countries. In order for Watsi to form a relationship with a Medical Partner, they must maintain the highest of ethical standards and fit the following criteria:

              <p class="verse__copy">
              Yes, 100% of your donation covers the cost of medical care for the patient of your choice. Your donation is not pooled into a general programming fund, your donation does not go to help run Watsi’s operations, and your donation does not go to fundraising activities. Watsi even covers the credit card processing fees (2.4% + $0.30 per transaction) so that every cent of your donation directly funds medical treatment.

              <p class="verse__copy">
              Being completely transparent about where your donation goes is one of our highest values. We ensure 100% transparency in a number of different ways:

                <ol class="verse__list--ordered">
                  <li class="verse__item">
                  Publication of all financial transactions: We post all of our financials on our Google Transparency Document, including screenshots of funds transfers for every patient.

                  <li class="verse__item">
                  Real updates: You will receive an update and photo about the outcome of the treatment you funded.

                  Partnering with the best: We work with organizations that have received distinction for their work and are well-respected in the global health community. To learn more about our Medical Partners, you can view their information on each patient profile on Watsi.
                  </li>
                  <li class="verse__item">
                  Double Due-Diligence: We have strong personal relationships with each of our Medical Partners (the Executive Director of our first Medical Partner flew to San Francisco and slept on Chase’s couch for a week to discuss the partnership), but we always perform initial and ongoing due diligence to ensure they meet our Medical Partner Criteria (see “What is a Medical Partner”). Because all of our Medical Partners are affiliated with a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization in the US, they are also subject to the tax-exempt rules and regulations of the Internal Revenue Service and are required to release all of their financial information for inspection on an annual basis. Therefore, all of our Medical Partners undergo due diligence investigations by both Watsi and the US Government to ensure that they are organizations of the highest integrity.

                  <li class="verse__item">
                  Direct transfers: Watsi funds are transferred directly to our Medical Partner for the purpose of covering the cost of the patient’s medical treatment. They are never handled by the patient and are never released to anyone for discretionary spending.

              <p class="verse__copy">
              The Medical Partner identifies a patient that needs low-cost, high-impact medical care and submits the profile to Watsi. If the profile meets our criteria, we accept it and guarantee the Medical Partner that we will cover the cost of providing care to that patient. Watsi posts the profile online, Watsi donors fund it, and the Medical Partner provides care to the patient. After the treatment is provided, the Medical Partner sends Watsi an update about the outcome of the treatment. Once Watsi receives the update, we send it to the donors who supported that patient and transfer the funds to the Medical Partner’s PayPal account to cover the cost of the treatment.

              <h3 class="verse__heading" id="about">Why are funds transferred to Medical Partners via PayPal?</h3>
              <p class="verse__copy">
              Watsi transfers funds to each Medical Partner’s verified PayPal account. It’s up to the Medical Partner to withdraw and/or transfer those funds however is most cost effective for their organization. The majority of our Medical Partners withdraw Watsi funds to a US bank account and bundle international transfers periodically in order to reduce the cost of international transfer fees.

              <h3 class="verse__heading" id="about">Why doesn't Watsi transfer funds before medical care is provided?</h3>
              <p class="verse__copy">
              We did this in the beginning, but after conversations with our Medical Partners and counseling from trusted advisers, we decided that it actually makes more sense to transfer funds immediately after care is provided. All patient profiles are accepted by Watsi before the patient receives care. This enables Medical Partners to treat patients whenever makes the most medical sense, operating under the guarantee that Watsi will cover the cost of care. For a detailed description about how we arrived at this conclusion, see this blog post.

            <section class="verse">
              <h3 class="verse__heading" id="about">Am I really funding medical care for the patient?</h3>
              <p class="verse__copy">
              Yes. Your donation directly covers the cost of care for the patient you choose. Medical Partners provide care to patients accepted by Watsi operating under the guarantee that the cost of care will be paid for by donors. In this sense, Watsi operates much like a traditional health insurance company. When you go to the doctor, your doctor calls your health insurance provider to ensure they’ll cover the cost of care. Your doctor then provides care operating under the guarantee that it will be paid for by the insurance company.

              <h3 class="verse__heading" id="about">Would patients still receive care if their treatment wasn’t funded?</h3>
              <p class="verse__copy">
              This is a tough one. What we’re finding is that it depends on the Medical Partner and the case. In some cases, there is no way the patient would receive care without Watsi. In other cases, it’s entirely possible that the Medical Partner would find another way to pay for the patient’s care, perhaps through another donor or organization. What we do know is that each case funded on Watsi represents one of two things: an expansion of the capacity of the Medical Partner to reach someone they couldn’t serve before, or a push to ensure that the Medical Partner is able to serve that one additional person.
